what is  done till now?
we created script in controller
to upload images

if no image read, we create one
else
we go back to view with error message
image already exists indatabase

we write continue to skip to next image

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Test
1) Try saving an image
2) Image is not currently in database
	-> Run Upload

3) check database , we will find one image extra
