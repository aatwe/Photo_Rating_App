How to check how our database looks like?
Sequel pro
connect  to homestead
go to facemash2022  project 

we will find tables as below:

games -> columns as id , winner, loser,created_at, updated_at
images-> title , filename,country,score,wins,losses,rank,created_at,updated_at
migrations
password_resets
users


ALL GOOD!
