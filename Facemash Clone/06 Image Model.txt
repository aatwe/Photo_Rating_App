Image.php

class Image extends Model {

   protected $table = 'images';
	//games.php expects us to have table with name of games
	//defining explicitly app wontbreak
  //Specify what kind of parameters are most assignable

  protected $fillable =  [
	'title',
	'filename'
	'country'
	//score win loss and rank are not user input so can be calculated at backend
	//for now we will specify
	'score',
	'wins',
	'losses'
	'rank'
//good practice to mention table columns in model
coz then model can access it
//since we are not updating filename title and country, and just the other below
ALL We need is id
based on previous wins and losses we will calculate new wins and losses and update ourself
