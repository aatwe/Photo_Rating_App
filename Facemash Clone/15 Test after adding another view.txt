Refresh

i got 2 images from left and right on view
hover on each to see won,lost,score
also on top of image i see
rank, "her bio is this" below


Will it run on clicking? no, there is no update method code

Every time we refresh we get 2 different images



1) Right click inspect
	we see game.php
		we see a form
		<form method="POST" action="http://facemash2016.app:8000/game/52">.....
(form method-‘POST' actionu'http://faccmnsh2016.opp:8000/9030/52' accept-charac:-'U?F-8' claun-"form-horizontn1"><input nume-‘_ncthod' typo-'hiddan' value-"PATCH'><input name-"_tokcn' type-‘hiddon'

<input type-"hiddcn‘ class-"Zora-control' maze-"loser" id—"26' value-'26'><linput>
</div>
			
		What is this form doing? using post method passing an id of image 52 and 26	//for currently visible images	
									if you refresh these value change
							The random shuffle must be unique 71^71 times
In form 1
		Which is the winner image? 52 
		Which is loser?26
In form 2
		Which is the winner image? 26 
		Which is loser?52
	By clicking any 1 form we are passing nformation about both images

How to make stats button work?

1) Routes.php
add another route

Route::resource('images/stats','ImageController@stats');	//for the stats button

2) Imagecontroller.php
	Create new method called stats
public function stats($){	//after adding stats button in file #15	
			//What does stats do? give all  the images
	$images = image::all();
	return view('pages.stats', compact('images'));	//serve pages.stats and pass collection
}


What happens after adding another stat?
We get all image in database with win loss and scores and "Not enough data to build ranking"
